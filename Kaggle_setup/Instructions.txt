First, edit the Initial_Setup.sh file and change the directory that it takes the .json file from to be your own directory, do not change the second directory that it copies the file to.

Then, run "bash Initial_setup.sh" on the command line

Now, you edit download_file.py to change the download_path to be the path to your MLP_CW file on your device.

Then, save your changes and run "python download_file.py" in the command line.
